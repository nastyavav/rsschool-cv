## About me

My goals: to deepen the knowledge in frontend development obtained at the university, to learn new technologies and apply them in practice.

I consider myself a very responsible, organized, team-oriented and responsive person. I'm committed to constant self-improvement through learning and developing both my professional skills and personal qualities.

My experience so far includes an internship at an IT company where I contributed to developing styles and Vue.js components for an internal project. The elements I created will be used in further development of the project.

I want to grow as a frontend developer, work in a team environment, and build high-quality projects.
